Software download also great.The only surprise was that the one I ordered, (USB) doesn't work with an iPad.I was thinking it would work with both PC and iPad. My mistake. I use this with Logic Pro X on an iMac running Mavericks (it's replacing an Mbox) and with a Sony Vaio running Windows 7 and get excellent results (don't forget to install the Windows drivers or you'll run into latency issues). I also use it with the Auria App on my iPad Air. I did appreciate the direct line in switch...I could hear exactly what was being played into the unit without having to route through the computer. That was a nice feature. More recently, I was very happy to get this working with my ipad mini. I did purchase a recommended usb powered hub Belkin model &#34; F4U020&#34; and with that - I'm good to play music into and out of my ipad. Focusrite. An industry standard.I bought this specifically for use with an iPad to do mobile recording. The app I use is Auria, but GarageBand will work as well. Be sure to use/buy a POWERED USB hub in order to power the Scarlett.Wonderfully quiet device. Simple to use and the mic/instrument inputs are very warm sounding. It is truly shocking to see that you can achieve some VERY convincing, near commercial grade recording with this interface. Mac OS X 10.8.42: UpdateAmazon didn't sent me a 3rd replacement. And I'm really glad they didn't. I ended up saving a lot of money and buyingApogee Duet Audio Interface for iPad & Mac. After using Duet, I can tell you that any sound interface priced between 60 to 200 are the same thing. You may as well buy the simplest cheapest sound interface instead of this show off failure.I am very very VERY surprised about how many stars this product has. when i conect the headphones into the interface and give a test, i cant hear a suitable volume, i hear it very low; and if i increase the volume, this saturated.. very good this is honestly the best interface I've used for recording. this is a must but item you won't regret it. this is a beautiful piece of hardware. sounds really good. easy to use. and the director monitor function is great. the software that came with it is outdated and does not support Mavericks. however, I got on the help line and the gentlemen pointed me to a program called reaper that helped install the software so that I can take full advantage of it's benefits.Other than that! It's GREAT! and I love recording my guitar on it. Clean with no noise.\",\n",
